# usableoverlay
the only usable overlay gamepad for retroarch

only enough buttons for GBA emulation. AB, LR, Start/Select, and d-pad.
basically the same thing as a gameboy layout, but the AB buttons are mirrored. Instead of A being to the top right of B, its to the top left. this makes it easier to hold B and press A, like how you need to for platformers.
not only this, but theres a small overlap on the A and B button hitboxes. This makes it even easier to press both buttons at once. its not large enough that you'll accidentally press both buttons, but its large enough to make the overlay usable.
there are no other overlays like this that i have found, which is surprising. because of this, im calling this one the only usable overlay for retroarch, soley because of being able to press A and B at the same time.
playing mario is actually possible now.
