# usableoverlay
the only usable overlay gamepad for retroarch

MAP X TO B IN CONTROL SETTINGS FOUND IN THE QUICK MENU (PRESS RETROARCH LOGO DURING PLAY) IF YOU WANT NES GAMES PLAYABLE IN PORTRAIT MODE.

**disclaimer**

this is about as much of a replacement for a controller as a ryzen 3 is a replacement for a ryzen 5. it not as capable, but its good enough to do most things, and in a few things you won't even tell the difference. don't expect this to be just like a real controller, but do expect it to be decent enough to actually enjoy playing games.

**how it works**

basically the same thing as a gameboy layout, but the AB buttons are mirrored. Instead of A being to the top right of B, its to the top left. this makes it easier to hold B and press A, like how you need to for platformers.
not only this, but theres a small overlap on the A and B button hitboxes. This makes it even easier to press both buttons at once. its not large enough that you'll accidentally press both buttons, but its large enough to make the overlay usable.
same goes for landscape mode but SNES layout with reversed XA and YB to make Super Mario World better.

there are no other overlays like this that i have found, which is surprising. because of this, im calling this one the only usable overlay for retroarch, soley because of being able to press A and B at the same time.
playing mario is actually possible now.

**extra info you might like**

the squares on the dpad are up+left and down+right and such, and there is in fact a refresh button. its just invis. next to the menu and fast foward buttons. invis because it would likely never be used, but still to have just in case.
